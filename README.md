# Mech105_Algorithms
I wrote all of these algorthms in my spring 2022 semester at Colorado State University as an undergrad. This directory contains functions to solve for the following objects:
* Creating a matrix that that follows various rules (read the README in the Matrices directory for more information)
* A root finding algorithm that uses false position
* An algorithm that uses Gaussian elimination to solve for the upper and lower matrices
* An algorithm that uses Simpson's 1/3 Rule to solve for the integral of a given set of data
* An algorithm that can find the linear regression from a given set of data
