# Special Matrix Algorithm
Function format: function [A] = specialMatrix(n,m)
* A function that returns a n x m matrix with elements that has the following values:
    * The value of each element in the first row is the number of the column
    * The value of each element in the first column in the number of the row
    * The rest of the elements each has a value equal to the sum of the element above it and element to the left
* Inputs:
  * n is the number of rows
  * m the number of columns
* Outputs:
  * A is a matrix that follows the above rules
* An error will be thrown if two arguments are not inputted
