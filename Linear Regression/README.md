# Linear Regression Function
Format of the function: function [fX, fY, slope, intercept, Rsquared] = linearRegression(x,y)
* Computes the linear regression of a data set given x and y data points. This will take out outliers that are outside the interquartile range (which was determined using the Minitab method). This will also sort the data for lowest y-value to highest y-value.
  * Inputs:
    * x: x-values for our data set
    * y: y-values for our data set
  * Outputs:
    * fX: x-values with outliers removed
    * fY: y-values with outliers removed
    * slope: slope from the linear regression y=mx+b
    * intercept: intercept from the linear regression y=mx+b
    * Rsquared: R^2, a.k.a. coefficient of determination
