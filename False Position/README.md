# False Positon Algorithm
Function setup: function [root, fx, ea, iter] = falsePosition(func, xl, xu, es, maxit, varargin)
* The falsePosition finds the root of a function using false position method, given a function, upper, and lower guess. Beware when using, that your guesses (or function) isn't near an infelction point, as that may max out the maximum ammount of iterations that is set.
    * Inputs:
        * func - the functions being evaluated
        * xl - the lower guess
        * xu - the upper guess
        * es - the desired relative error (defaults to 0.0001%)
        * maxit - the maximum number of iteration to use (defaults to 200)
    * Outputs:
        * root - the estimated root location
        * fx - the function evaluated at the root location
        * ea - the approximate relative error (%)
        * iter - how many iterations were performed
