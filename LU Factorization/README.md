# LU Factorization Algorithm
Function format: function [L, U, P] = luFactor(A)
* Use of Gaussian elimination and pivoting to produce the lower triangular matrix and the upper triangular matrix. The matrix needs to be a square matrix or else this function won't work.
  * inputs:
    *	A = coefficient matrix
  * outputs:
    *	L = lower triangular matrix
    *	U = upper triangular matrix
    * P = the permutation matrix
